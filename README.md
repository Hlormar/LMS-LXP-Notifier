# UTMN LMS & LXP notifier
Is an android application, developed to notify students of Tyumen university about new tasks and upcoming deadlines on UTMN LMS / LXP, also to provide easy access for weekly task schedule. This application is being developed as a product of the English project assignment by freshmans (aproximately 10.2024 - current time).

The application executes the python script using Chaquopy https://github.com/Hlormar/UTMN-LMS-parser to extract the LMS calendar data.
